## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

The rationale of the `risk.assessr` package is to validate R packages. As such, it runs processes
such as `RCMD check` and `test coverage` which may generate ERRORs, NOTEs, and WARNINGs in packages.
The tests in `risk.assessr` produce the following outputs in the test process.

`risk.assessr::run_rcmdcheck` produces these:

* **NOTE message** checking CRAN incoming feasibility ...Warning in read.dcf(file.path(dir, parts[2L])) :
  cannot open compressed file 'C:/Users/edward.gillian/AppData/Local/Temp/RtmpEVc1Jb/file5d30723213de/test.package.0002.Rcheck/00_pkg_src/test.package.0002/LICENSE', probable reason 'No such file or directory'

* **Cause**: This note occurs due to a missing LICENSE file in the test package.
  
* **NOTE message** checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... [11s] NOTE
Maintainer: 'Jane Doe <jane@example.com>'
New submission

* **Cause**: This note occurs due to a new submission for CRAN incoming feasibility in the test package.
  
* **ERROR message**  Running 'testthat.R'

* **Cause**: This error occurs due to a test failure in the test package.

`risk.assessr::get_bioconductor_data` produces these:

* **ERROR message**  
Checking Bioconductor version: 3.17
Checking Bioconductor version: 3.18
Checking Bioconductor version: 3.19
Checking Bioconductor version: 3.17

Checking Bioconductor version: 3.18
Skipping Bioconductor version 3.18 due to error: Simulated error
Checking Bioconductor version: 3.19
Skipping Bioconductor version 3.19 due to error: Simulated error

* **Cause**: This error is simulated error to skip Bioconductor versions.

`risk.assessr::get_github_data` produces these:

* **ERROR message** 
Failed to fetch repository details:  Mocked API call failure 

* **Cause**: This error is simulated API call failure.

* **ERROR message** 
Failed to fetch commits:  Mocked commits API failure 

* **Cause**: This error is simulated commits API failure.

* **ERROR message** 
Failed to fetch repository details:  Simulated API failure 

* **Cause**: This error is simulated repository details API failure.

`risk.assessr::get_package_host_info` produces these:

* **ERROR message** 
Failed to fetch repository details:  Simulated API failure 

* **Cause**: This error is simulated repository details API failure.

`risk.assessr::install_package_local` produces these:

* **message** 
installing mock_package locally
mock_package installed locally
mock_package installed locally
installing non_existent_directory locally
No such file or directory: non_existent_directory

* **Cause**: This message is simulating failure when there is no local directory for installation.

`risk.assessr::run_coverage` produces these:

* **NOTE message** 
code coverage for test.package.0005 successful
R coverage for test.package.0005 had notes: no testable functions found
running code coverage for file4c446b4972f

* **Cause**: The test package had no testable functions.


`risk.assessr::run_coverage` produces these:

* **ERROR message** 
code coverage for file4c446b4972f unsuccessful
R coverage for file4c446b4972f failed. Read in the covr output to see what went wrong: 

* **Cause**: Code coverage failed as the test package had no testable functions.

`risk.assessr::unpack_tarball` produces these:

* **message** 
unpacking empty.tar.gz locally
not able to unpack empty.tar.gz locally

* **Cause**: This test is testing if the code can handle an empty tar file.
