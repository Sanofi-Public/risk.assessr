# risk.assessr

# Overview

Open-source projects can improve how clinical trials work by making them more transparent and collaborative to solve problems and define a common standard in the clinical trial ecosystem.

Successful open source packages such as `admiral`, `tern` and as well as collaborative initiatives (`Pharmaverse`, `Transcellerate`, `Phuse`) could greatly standardize and harmonize processes for different laboratories as well as allowing for faster deliverable for submission.

However, open source raises inherent challenges in terms of:

| Aspect         | Security                                                | Legal                                                 | Operational                                                                                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Considerations | \- Vulnerability issues <br> - Confidentiality concerns | \- Is the source code under a non-permissive license? | \- Is the package maintained by an active community? <br> - Does it follow good practices? <br> - Is it sustainable? |


We need to use open-source projects responsibly and safely by adhering to best practices and ensure the reliability of the package being utilized for FDA submission.


Our goal is to establish a comprehensive and reliable package that helps to determine a packageâ€™s reliability and security in terms of maintenance, documentation, and dependencies.

This package is designed to carry out a risk assessment for internal or open source R packages.

This packages can:

-   Actively run `R CMD check` (a series of technical checks that ensure examples run\
    successfully, tests pass, the packages are compatible with other packages on CRAN)

-   Provide some answers as to why certain steps are not passing

-   Actively run `test coverage` checks to ensure tests pass and calculate unit test coverage

-   create a `traceability matrix` that matches the function / test descriptions to tests\
    and match to test pass/fail and associated test coverage

-   Can be executed in several environments (different OS, wise) and with different R\
    versions

-   Can work with package versions


-   Provide a overall risk score



It calculates risk metrics such as:

**Core metrics** - includes R command check, unit test coverage and
composite coverage of dependencies

**Documentation metrics** - availability of vignettes, news tracking,
example(s), return object description for exported functions, and type
of license



# Description

This package has the following steps in the workflow to assess the risk
of an R package using riskmetric:

Finding a source for package information locally (**renv.lock** file or
installed local package **tar.gz** file Assessing the package under
validation criteria and scoring the assessment criteria `assess_pkg()`

The results are assembled in a dataset of validation criteria containing
an overall risk score for each package as shown in the example below.

This package executes the following tasks:

1.  upload the source package(`tar.gz` file) locally

2.  Unpack the `tar.gz` file

3.  Install the package locally

4.  Run code coverage

5.  Run a traceability matrix

6.  Run R CMD check

7.  Run risk assessment metrics using default weighting



# Installation

## from github repository

- Create a `Personal Access Token` (PAT) on `github`

  - Log into your `github` account
  - Go to the token settings URL using the [Token Settings
    URL](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

- Create a `.Renviron` file with your GITHUBTOKEN as:

<!-- -->

    # .Renviron
    GITHUBTOKEN=dfdxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxfdf

- restart R session
- You can install the package with:

<!-- -->

``` r
auth_token = Sys.getenv("GITHUBTOKEN")
devtools::install_github("Sanofi-GitHub/bp-art-risk.assessr", ref = "main", auth_token = auth_token)

```

## from CRAN

``` r
install.package("risk.assessr")
```

# Assessing package

To assess your package, do the following steps:

1 - save your package as a `tar.gz` file

- This can be done in `RStudio` -\> `Build Tab` -\> `More` -\>
  `Build Source Package`

2 - Run the following code sample and use `file.choose` to load your
`tar.gz` file

``` r
library(risk.assessr)

# for local tar.gz R package
risk_assess_package <- risk.assessr::risk_assess_pkg()
```

OR

To assess Open source package on CRAN/Bioconductor

```
library(risk.assessr)
# The function will retrieve the latest version of the package if no version is provided

results <- sanofi.risk.assessr::assess_pkg_r_package(package_name, version=NA)
```


# Result: Metrics and Risk assessment

``` r
# to check the overall riskmetric results
risk_assess_package$results
```

# Current/Future directions

- Experimental analysis to define overall risk profile
- Open source database with `risk.assessr` data on package and on internal environment
